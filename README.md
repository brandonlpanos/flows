**Continuous normalizing flows**  

Contains a notebook showing a simple implementation of Nomrlaizng flows. Videos show the mapping between two simple Gausians and two more complex distributions. Our team is busy designing a computationally efficient continuous normalizing flow model using the adjoint sensitivity method to extract the full posterior distribution from non/LTE inversions of spectrophotometric signals taken by the Swedish solar telescope. Results are pending.
